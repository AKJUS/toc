# Dragonfly Governance Review

What follows is a governance review and assessment for the Dragonfly project.

* **Date Completed:** September 2025
* [Dragonfly Graduation Application](https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1358)
* [Dragonfly Governance Review Request](https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1599)

## Summary and Assessment

This is a follow-up after an initial assessment was made with the follow-up
items outlined in a [Dragonfly governance follow-up items issue].

[Dragonfly governance follow-up items issue]: https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/issues/27


**Status:** Satisfactory

Dragonfly is a small project that utilizes a Maintainer Council style of 
governance that is appropriate for its size. They have made significant
improvements since the initial assessment in May of this year - both in the
general clarification of governance, and growing their contributor base.


### Executing the Assessment

[Bob Killen] executed the review in September 2025 following an initial review
in April by [Khallai Taylor].

### Must-Fix Items

**The following issues have been identified that need to be resolved before
[project milestone or other requirement]:**

None.


### Points of Excellence

**The following aspects of governance are exemplary, and can be referenced as
examples for other projects to copy:**

Dragonfly's contributor and organizational diversity has made significant
improvements since the initial assessment in May of this year. Previously, Ant
Group was responsible for 75%~ of contributions and is now around 55%~ with a
60%~ growth in [active organizations] and an 80%~ growth in
[active contributors], along with a growing [contributor retention rate].

[active contributions]: https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/project/d7y/contributors?timeRange=custom&start=2025-06-01&end=2025-08-31&widget=active-contributors
[contributor retention rate]: https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/project/d7y/contributors?timeRange=past365days&start=2024-09-14&end=2025-09-14&widget=retention


### Areas for Improvement

**Over the next year, the project should work on the following issues to improve
its governance, these are considered non-blocking:**

Dragonfly has made **massive strides** at improving their overall organizational
and contributor diversity since the initial assessment earlier this year.
However, Ant Group is still responsible for a large portion of the overall
contributions. They should continue what they're doing to further recruit and
grow a larger contributor base to reduce the dependence on a single
organization.

Other than that, there are a few small things such as additional clarification
around subprojects that would be beneficial to improve discoverability and
understanding, but not required or blocking. Several of the items have been
[updated] to improve this while the governance review was being completed.

## Review

**The following review primarily consists of an audit on the project's
self-assessment in their Graduation application.**


### Governance Summary

Dragonfly is a smaller project that utilizes a Maintainer Council style of 
[governance] where the body of [elected maintainers][maintainers] are
responsible for guiding the project, serving as the security response team, and
acting as the technical authority for the project.

Unlike most Maintainer Councils, they do utilize subprojects - but it is small
in scope with one subproject generally encompassing the [Dragonfly] components
and repos, and the other [Nydus] in its singular repo.


### Governance Evolution

**Governance has continuously been iterated upon by the project as a result of
their experience applying it, with the governance history demonstrating
evolution of maturity alongside the project's maturity evolution.**
<br>
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Suggested

Dragonfly has not needed to make significant changes to their governance, but 
it has evolved with changes to things like contributor ladder. The evolution can
be seen in the commit history of several of their governance docs:
* [COMMUNITY_LADDER.md](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/commits/master/COMMUNITY_LADDER.md)
* [COMMUNITY_MEMBERSHIP.md](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/commits/master/COMMUNITY_MEMBERSHIP.md)
* [GOVERNANCE.md](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/commits/master/GOVERNANCE.md)

**NOTE:** Some of these files were relocated/consolidated and commit history is
limited.


### Discoverability

**Clear and discoverable project governance documentation.**
<br>
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

Dragonfly's governance and contributing docs are kept in their community repo
and it is linked both from their [website], [org readme], and all README docs
across the GitHub organization.

[website]: https://d7y.io/
[org readme]: https://github.com/dragonflyoss#contributing


### Accuracy and Clarity

**Governance is up to date with actual project activities, including any
meetings, elections, leadership, or approval processes.**
<br>
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

The project's [governance] is up to date with [meeting minutes] being PR'ed into
the community repo.

A recent example, in the meeting minutes for the [2025-09-09] meeting, there was
a call to promote two contributors to members, and the issues (candidate1
candidate2) were opened shortly thereafter.

[2025-09-09]: https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/befc34ece8d1bf2a6898e4bbfda4f5bf7b073f1e/meetings/maintainer/2025-09-09/README.md
[candidate1]: https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/issues/79
[candidate2]: https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/issues/80


**Governance clearly documents [vendor-neutrality] of project direction.**
<br>
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

Vendor neutrality is listed as one of Dragonfly's [core principles].

[core principles]: https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/befc34ece8d1bf2a6898e4bbfda4f5bf7b073f1e/GOVERNANCE.md#core-principles


### Decisions and Role Assignments

**Document how the project makes decisions on leadership roles, contribution
acceptance, requests to the CNCF, and changes to governance or project goals.**
<br>
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required 

Decision requirements are documented across two documents, but follow the same
process.

For general decision making, Dragonfly's process can be found in their
[Community Membership docs] which calls for public discussion and consensus
building with an [escalation clause] where a vote can be called among the 
Dragonfly maintainers where a simple majority (50%) can vote on the item.

For changes to governance, the voting requirements are outlined in the
[Amending this Document] section of [GOVERNANCE.md] (2/3 supermajority vote of 
maintainers).

[escalation clause]: https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/befc34ece8d1bf2a6898e4bbfda4f5bf7b073f1e/COMMUNITY_MEMBERSHIP.md#solving-conflicts
[Amending this document]: https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/befc34ece8d1bf2a6898e4bbfda4f5bf7b073f1e/GOVERNANCE.md#amending-this-document
[GOVERNANCE.md]: https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/befc34ece8d1bf2a6898e4bbfda4f5bf7b073f1e/GOVERNANCE.md


**Document how role, function-based members, or sub-teams are assigned,
onboarded, and removed for specific teams (example: Security Response
Committee).**
<br>
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

All role membership requirements and processes are outlined in the 
[Community Membership docs], with the [private maintainer list] acting as
Security Response Team.

As for the process, Dragonfly uses a combination of [nomination templates] and
gitvote with scaling requirements based on the role. For convenience, the 
chart is listed below:

| Role       | Nomination Period | Voting Period | Eligible Voters                   | Voting Requirements    |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Member     | 7 days            | 7 days        | Current Maintainers and Approvers | Simple majority (>50%) |
| Approver   | 7 days            | 14 days       | Current Maintainers only          | Simple majority (>50%) |
| Maintainer | 7 days            | 14 days       | Current Maintainers only          | Supermajority (â‰¥65%)   |

### Maintainers and Maintainer Lifecycle

**Document a complete maintainer lifecycle process (including roles, onboarding,
offboarding, and emeritus status).**
<br>
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

The maintainer lifecycle process is documented in [Managing Membership]
section of their [Community Membership docs].

[Managing Membership]: https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/befc34ece8d1bf2a6898e4bbfda4f5bf7b073f1e/COMMUNITY_MEMBERSHIP.md#managing-membership


**Demonstrate usage of the maintainer lifecycle with outcomes, either through
the addition or replacement of maintainers as project events have required.**
<br>
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

A history of maintainer changes including promoting some, and moving others to 
emeritus can be seen in the [commit history] of the maintainer list.

**NOTE:** The maintainer list has moved repos and locations. While only the 
most recent is linked above, it can be seen in the history of the original
locations as well.

<br>
**Incubating:** Required | **Graduated:** Required

Dragonfly has 13 [listed maintainers][maintainers] in it's [community repo].
While the [majority of contributions] can still be attributed to two active
maintainers, there is enough diversity and [growth among the others] that it is
not a current concern.
