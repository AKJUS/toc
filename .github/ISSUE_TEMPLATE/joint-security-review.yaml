        The first step in a [joint security review](https://tag-security.cncf.io/community/assessments/guide/joint-assessment/) is a maintainer-completed security self-assessment.
        
        **New to the assessment process?**:
        Learn more about the self-assessment [here](https://tag-security.cncf.io/community/assessments/guide/self-assessment/).
        The [Open and Secure](https://tag-security.cncf.io/community/assessments/Open_and_Secure.pdf) book can be used to guide you through the self-assessment.

        - label: I confirm that I have completed my project's self-assessment and understand that this is a prerequisite for a joint review.

        While the final assessment will be represented in a Markdown file in the `cncf/toc` repository, we recommend using a Google Doc
        for the initial draft to streamline the process. This link will be the primary location for our joint review.
