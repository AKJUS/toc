# Governance Review for Crossplane Graduation

What follows is a governance review for the [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io)
project. The review was conducted as part of due diligence for Crossplane's
application to move to CNCF's Graduated level in
<https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1788>.

**The review primarily consists of an audit on the project's
self-assessment in their Graduation application.**

- Graduation application submission: <https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1788>
- Previous submissions (for information only): <https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1397>, <https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/1254>

## Summary and Assessment

**Status:** Satisfactory

### Executing the Assessment

Mario Fahlandt (@mfahlandt) and Josh Gavant (@joshgav) conducted this review in
September-October 2025. The review follows CNCF TOC's [governance review
template](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/toc_subprojects/project-reviews-subproject/governance-review-template.md)
and [accompanying
guidelines](https://github.com/cncf/toc/tree/main/toc_subprojects/project-reviews-subproject).

### Must-Fix Items

**The following issues have been identified that need to be resolved before
graduation:**

- The list of project maintainers in
[github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/project-maintainers.csv](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/project-maintainers.csv)
should be updated to reflect the current maintainership.

### Points of Excellence

**The following aspects of governance are exemplary, and can be referenced as
examples for other projects to copy:**

- The project provides a good example of bootstrapping a steering committee over
the course of several years, starting with self-appointed maintainers and
evolving into an elected group.
- The project offers *membership* for users without maintainer status, enabling
more belonging and diversity of viewpoints by including non-maintainers.
- The project offers discussion groups ("SIGs") for interested parties to
further collaborate.

### Areas for Improvement

**Over the next year, the project should work on the following issues to improve
its governance, these are considered non-blocking:**

- A governance document (e.g., GOVERNANCE.md) should be added to each repo in
github.com/crossplane-contrib listing the maintainers responsible for that repo
and referring to the master governance doc in crossplane/crossplane for further
information. This will make governance of individual repositories discoverable.
- A Code of Conduct document (e.g. CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) should be added to each
repo in github.com/crossplane-contrib linking to the crossplane/crossplane code
of conduct, which itself refers to the CNCF's code of conduct.
- A major plurality of
[contributions](https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/project/crossplane/contributors)
to Crossplane come from a single company. If these contributions would cease the
project would likely struggle. The project should seek to engage more companies
to participate more.
- The current steering committee has three of five seats held by a single
company, though in the next election in Febrary 2026 only two seats will be
allowed to be held by a single company. More contributing companies would
facilitate a more diverse steering committee.

## Review

### Governance Summary

Crossplane is a framework for creating custom resource definitions and
implementations for Kubernetes which then serve as a control plane for a
software platform. The core framework is hosted in
[github.com/crossplane](https://github.com/crossplane) and community-maintained
definitions and implementations are hosted in
[github.com/crossplane-contrib](https://github.com/crossplane-contrib). The
framework is useful only together with implementations, so the components in
crossplane-contrib are to be considered part of the project. Both "crossplane"
and "crossplane-contrib" are governed in common and both will be assessed in
this report.

The project has a top-level 5-member [Steering
Committee](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#steering-committee)
and subsidiary groups governed by [Repository
Governance](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#repository-governance).
Governance policies are in metadata in the main
[crossplane/crossplane](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane) repo. Repos in
crossplane-contrib generally include an OWNERS.md file listing maintainers and
no further governance docs.

### Governance Evolution

**Governance has continuously been iterated upon by the project as a result of
their experience applying it, with the governance history demonstrating
evolution of maturity alongside the project's maturity evolution.**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Suggested

The project bootstrapped a steering committee in 2020 and clarified the role of
maintainers and members at the time. Steering committee members were chosen from
existing senior maintainers; notably, all work for Upbound and continue to serve
as 3/5 members of the SC today. Two more members, both from other companies,
were added in elections in 2024 and reelected in 2025. An election should be
held in early 2026 at which point no more than 2 members of the steering
committee will be from a single company.

The history of the project's governance can be found on GitHub at
<https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/commits/main/GOVERNANCE.md>. It was
founded by creators of the Rook project who applied their experience there in
establishing initial policies for Crossplane.

The most recent significant
[update](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/pull/6290) to governance put
in place governance for community extensions in crossplane-contrib.

The project experimented with a membership type for Reviewers but later removed
that. The project also has a membership type of "Member" for contributors who
are not maintainers.

### Discoverability

**Clear and discoverable project governance documentation.**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

Governance for the crossplane and crossplane-contrib orgs is described in
[crossplane/crossplane/GOVERNANCE.md](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md).
All aspects of the life cycle for Crossplane leadership positions, including the
steering committee and repository maintainers (committers), are described in
detail in this document. Steering committee members are also listed there.

A charter describing the project's intent is in
[crossplane/crossplane/CHARTER.md](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/CHARTER.md).

Most repositories in crossplane-contrib include an OWNERS.md document listing
that repo's maintainers. Most also include a short "Governance and Owners"
section in their root README.md. Repositories for functions, however, do not
include these documents.

There is no GOVERNANCE.md document in each crossplane-contrib repo and it could
be difficult for users to discover their governance. Each repo *could* have a
GOVERNANCE.md document with a link back to the primary doc in
crossplane/crossplane.

### Accuracy and Clarity

**Governance is up to date with actual project activities, including any
meetings, elections, leadership, or approval processes.**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

The governance is up to date with the most recent steering committee election in
February 2025:
[crossplane/crossplane#6304](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/pull/6304).

Election processes for the steering committee are documented in crossplane's
GOVERNANCE.md. Timing of elections is implied to be when current terms end. The
criteria and process for establishing repository/subproject Maintainers are also
documented in GOVERNANCE.md. It is clearly stated there that conflicts and
issues that cannot be resolved by repository maintainers are to be referred to
the steering committee.

Public meetings are listed in the [community
calendar](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/crossplane).
There do not seem to be public meetings for the steering committee or for
community extension projects. It seems the monthly Community meeting is intended
for all issues requiring live discussion.

**Governance clearly documents [vendor-neutrality] of project direction.**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

The [project
charter](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/CHARTER.md) states
that "Crossplane is a neutral place for vendors and individuals to come
together...." The [governance
document](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md)
states that the crossplane-contrib organization is also vendor-neutral. 

3 organizations are currently represented on the steering committee including
one service provider and two end users. The Crossplane site includes a link to
[a "commercial" page](https://www.crossplane.io/commercial) listing several
providers who use or support Crossplane in their offerings.

Following the next election the steering committee will have a maximum of 40% of
members from one company. The governance has a ["maximum
representation"](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#maximum-representation)
section that outlines how vendor neutrality is/will be ensured in the steering
committee's decision making.

Community extension projects are also governed by [clearly defined
policies](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#policies-for-community-extension-projects)
that promote vendor neutrality. For example, all projects must publish artifacts
strictly to the vendor-neutral community registry `xpkg.crossplane.io`.

### Decisions and Role Assignments

**Document how the project makes decisions on leadership roles, contribution
acceptance, requests to the CNCF, and changes to governance or project goals.**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

Decisions are first delegated to maintainers/owners of each repository and
ultimately the responsibility of the steering committee. Repository maintainers
are chosen by existing maintainers after demonstrating commitment and
contributions, and repository maintainers have relative autonomy within their
repo to approve contributions. The steering committee is the arbiter in case of
conflicts and escalations. Requests to the CNCF and changes to governance or
project goals require a 2/3 majority agreement from the steering committee.

Changes to governance are governed by a clearly defined process in
https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#updating-the-governance.

Project leadership (steering committee) election process is defined in
https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#election-process.
This process was followed for the most recent 2025 election.

Process for how each individual repository under the crossplane organizations
are maintained can be found in
https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#repository-governance.

Additionally, policies and guidelines for Community Extension Projects are
clearly defined in
https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#policies-for-community-extension-projects.

Contribution acceptance is augmented by the contributing guide at
https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/tree/main/contributing#contributing-code
and
https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/tree/main/contributing#code-review-process.

**Document how role, function-based members, or sub-teams are assigned,
onboarded, and removed for specific teams (example: Security Response
Committee).**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

Each repository has its own list of Owners/Maintainers in file OWNERS.md. The
main governance doc describes how maintainers should go about choosing
additional maintainers.

Unique tools are managed in their own repositories like other extensions and
they are listed
[here](https://docs.crossplane.io/v2.0/learn/community-extension-projects/#tools-and-utilities).

No additional special groups, such as a Security Response group, seem to exist.

Repository maintainers are added by this process:
https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#becoming-a-maintainer

Repository maintainers are removed by this process:
https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#removing-a-maintainer

Steering committee members are elected by this process:
https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#election-process

### Maintainers and Maintainer Lifecycle

**Document a complete maintainer lifecycle process (including roles, onboarding,
offboarding, and emeritus status).**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

A would-be maintainer would begin by contributing to issues and requests in a
crossplane or crossplane-contrib repository. After a series of such
contributions they would request maintainership from existing maintainers.
Existing maintainers would deliberately assign another series of issues to work
together with them on. After demonstrating competency and compatibility with
existing people and processes existing maintainers would elect the new
contributor to the list of repo maintainers and consummate that by adding them
to the repo's OWNERS.md file.

Maintainers who no longer will be participating are asked to voluntarily remove
themselves. If necessary, repository maintainers can remove them forcibly with a
2/3 vote of existing maintainers.

Repository maintainers are added by this process:
https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#becoming-a-maintainer

Repository maintainers are removed by this process:
https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#removing-a-maintainer

**Demonstrate usage of the maintainer lifecycle with outcomes, either through
the addition or replacement of maintainers as project events have required.**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

The history of OWNERS.md files in extension repos includes maintainer membership
changes over time, with both additions and removals (or movement to emeritus
status). See for example:

- https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/commits/main/OWNERS.md
- https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane-runtime/commits/main/OWNERS.md
- https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-sql/commits/master/OWNERS.md
- https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-ansible/commits/main/OWNERS.md

**Document complete list of current maintainers, including names, contact
information, domain of responsibility, and affiliation.**
**Incubating:** Required | **Graduated:** Required

Steering committee membership is in
https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#initial-steering-committee
where contact info is also provided:
https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#contact-info.

The maintainers of many repositories in the crossplane and crossplane-contrib
organizations are listed in an OWNERS.md file in each individual repository. For
example:

- core Crossplane: https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/OWNERS.md
- crossplane-runtime: https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane-runtime/blob/main/OWNERS.md
- provider-sql: https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-sql/blob/master/OWNERS.md
- provider-palette: https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-palette/blob/main/OWNERS.md

Community Extension Projects must keep these lists up to date per [the defined
policies](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#policies-for-community-extension-projects)
and lifecycle expectations.

**A number of active maintainers which is appropriate to the size and scope of
the project.**
**Incubating:** Required | **Graduated:** Required

5-6 people are named as owners in most repos in crossplane and
crossplane-contrib.

Across the entire Crossplane project, there are [183 different
companies](https://crossplane.devstats.cncf.io/d/5/companies-table?orgId=1&var-period_name=Since%20moving%20to%20incubating%20state&var-metric=committers)
that have committers (individuals with write permissions) on at least one
repository.

**Project maintainers from at least 2 organizations that demonstrates
survivability.**
**Incubating:** N/A | **Graduated:** Required

Across the entire Crossplane project, there are 183 different companies that
have committers (individuals with write permissions) on at least one repository.

Also, the steering committee for the Crossplane project is composed of
individuals from 3 separate organizations: Apple, Nokia, and Upbound.

Notably, 4/5
[owners](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/OWNERS.md) of
crossplane/crossplane work for one company.

### Ownership

**Code and Doc ownership in Github and elsewhere matches documented governance
roles.**
**Incubating:** Required | **Graduated:** Required

OWNERS.md files in most crossplane and crossplane-contrib repositories reflect
the documented maintainer roles defined in GOVERNANCE.md. For example,
https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/OWNERS.md lists current and
emeritus maintainers for that repo. Up-to-date ownership is a policy enforced
for all Community Extension Projects.

### Code of Conduct

**Document adoption and adherence to the CNCF Code of Conduct or the project's
CoC which is based off the CNCF CoC and not in conflict with it.**
**Incubating:** Required | **Graduated:** Required

The primary repo (crossplane/crossplane) and some crossplane-contrib repos
include a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md which links to the CNCF code of conduct. Some repos
in crossplane-contrib do not have a Code of Conduct.

**CNCF Code of Conduct is cross-linked from other governance.**
**Incubating:** Required | **Graduated:** Required

The primary repo (crossplane/crossplane) and some crossplane-contrib repos
include a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md which links to the CNCF code of conduct. Some repos
in crossplane-contrib do not have a Code of Conduct.

### Subprojects

**All subprojects, if any, are listed.**
**Incubating:** Required | **Graduated:** Required

All subprojects - repositories - are listed at
<https://docs.crossplane.io/v2.0/learn/community-extension-projects/>.

There are also Special Interest Groups ("SIGs") for different topics of interest
in the project, listed
[here](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane?tab=readme-ov-file#special-interest-groups-sig).
These are not documented elsewhere and are primarily Slack discussion groups
focused on particular topics.

**If the project has subprojects: subproject leadership, contribution, maturity
status documented, including add/remove process.**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

Governance of repositories in crossplane-contrib is discussed in the primary
governance document in crossplane/crossplane and OWNERS.md files in each repo.
The [official
list](https://docs.crossplane.io/v2.0/learn/community-extension-projects/) does
not discuss leadership or maturity.

Governance of SIGs is informal and not documented.

### Contributors and Community

**Contributor ladder with multiple roles for contributors.**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Suggested

Three roles exist for contributors: steering committee members, maintainers and
org members. The process to become one of these as documented in GOVERNANCE.md
is to make steady contributions and demonstrate compatibility with the existing
community.

- New member process: <https://github.com/crossplane/org/blob/main/processes/new-member.md>
- Becoming a maintainer: <https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#becoming-a-maintainer>
- Steering committee elections: <https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#election-process>

A list of current members is
[here](https://github.com/crossplane/org/blob/main/config/members-crossplane.yaml).
