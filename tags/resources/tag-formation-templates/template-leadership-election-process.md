# Leadership election process within the `<TAG NAME>`

<!--
This file is a template which can be used by TAGs to bootstrap their governance structure.
Please review this file carefully and make adjustments to better fit your TAG where needed.
-->

The TAG leadership as well as the leadership of working groups or projects follows a common set of rules to ensure a transparent, open and accessible role transition between contributors.
Contributors in leadership positions provide guidance and directions to TAG members and ensure that the efforts are in line with its mission and values, as well as the goals of the TAG.
Roles within the TAG outlining expectations and responsibilities are defined in the [roles](template-roles.md) governance document. <!-- ! UPDATE THE LINK ! -->

## Process of nominations

Leadership roles are open to all interested participants within the community. Depending on the needs of the community, as determined by the current TAG leadership team (Chairs and TLs), nominations may come from working group co-chairs, TAG co-chairs and/or tech leads and/or other community members. Each TAG is expected to define this for themselves.

The `<TAG NAME>` does not have a current limit on the amount of leadership roles. <!-- ! UPDATE IF DISCUSSED OTHERWISE ! -->

Final nominations will adhere to the [CNCF's TOC described process](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md#elections) as well as to the leadership nomination requirements described below.

Any individual who is a member of the `<TAG NAME>`, its working groups, or otherwise considered an active participant of the group may nominate another individual. <!-- Update if your TAG has a more restricted pool of nominators -->

The process of endorsing and selecting individuals will consider the following factors to ensure both the need for proper community representation and the necessary technical expertise: <!-- If the TAG has any additional items, such as leading a minimum number of projects, or facilitating a number meetings, they should be added to this list under "Body of work" -->

* Gender diversity
* Company diversity
* Geo diversity
* Number of nominations from different companies, people, regions for a single individual
* Existing body of work
* Justification provided during nomination

In case there are no individuals expressing interest in taking up leadership positions, an evaluation process for the TAG / working group or project archival may be initiated, as [outlined by the TOC](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md#retirement).

### Community timeline
